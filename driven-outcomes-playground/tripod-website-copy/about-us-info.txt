Empowering Schools, Inspiring Students: Shaping the Future Together

Since 2016, we’ve been on a mission to transform learning in schools across Australia. Operating under Driven Outcomes Pty Ltd, we have two main divisions: Tripod Enterprise Education, launched in 2016 to deliver dynamic programs for secondary students, and MiniBOSS Incursions, established in 2017 to provide engaging, specialist incursions tailored for primary students. Based in Alphington, Melbourne, the company is proudly owned and managed by its founders and directors, Betsy Tolmer and Marita D’Amico.

What began as a passion for creating engaging, hands-on educational experiences has grown into partnerships with over 500 schools and organisations, impacting more than 200,000 students.

Our vision is simple: to inspire students to develop essential life skills such as critical thinking, creativity, teamwork, problem-solving, communication, presentation skills, digital literacy, and financial literacy. At the same time, we empower educators with the tools they need to make a real difference in their classrooms.

At the heart of what we do are our programs—offering more than 30 different programs and comprehensive resources for teachers. Our programs range from half-day sessions to term-long projects. Designed to ignite curiosity, challenge thinking, and promote collaboration, our programs ensure that every student feels engaged, valued, and equipped to succeed. Whether through dynamic team-building activities or immersive workshops, we create meaningful learning experiences that leave a lasting impact.

Our latest initiative, Talk NOW!, focuses on one of the most important topics of our time: Consent and Respectful Relationships Education (RRE). This program equips educators with the resources they need to confidently teach respect, inclusivity, and empathy, helping build a safer, more respectful school community.

From the beginning, our goal has been to create programs that leave a lasting impact. Every school we partner with, and every student we reach, is a step toward shaping a more thoughtful, creative, and empowered generation.

As we continue to grow and evolve, our commitment remains the same: to inspire students, support educators, and create a future where every learner is equipped with the skills and mindset to thrive. Together, we are building a brighter tomorrow, one school, one student, and one program at a time.

What is Enterprise Education?
Enterprise Education is a model of learning that contributes to the self-development of young people. Through engaging in learning activities that mimic elements of the real world, students are given the opportunity to explore how their transferable skills and knowledge can be applied in the future. Our creative, enterprise-based incursions foster teamwork, communication and many other skills useful now and in the future as well as with potential employers.
