I have had an eclectic career, from working in Event Production, Human Resources, Marketing and Communications, Education and Career Consulting and I have even worked for Santa himself with project managing installation of Christmas Trees all over the city. In all my roles people have always been at the core, and my passion and purpose was finally realised when I started working on MiniBOSS and Tripod to connect young people with great learning experiences.

Betsy's favourite incursion
I simply can’t pick one, they are all my favourite, every time I run The Lab I say that The Lab is my fave, but then I will run a Create IT and I will say no, no, Create IT is my fave! I think they are all so unique and different every time we run them because the input of the students and that is my favourite thing that so much of the day is about who is in the room!

I have been a member of the Australia China Business Council, AustCham Beijing and also participated in the SME Working Group in Education in Beijing.
