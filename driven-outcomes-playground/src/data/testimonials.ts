    testimonial:
      "We worked with MiniBOSS to launch our Year 3 Enterprise Unit. The session proved to be the most professional and engaging incursion we had been involved in. So much so that our students continued the theme of becoming MiniBOSSes by starting up their own marketing company called ‘The Ideas Factory’. This incursion became the framework of our term and encouraged our students to think about the role enterprise plays in their lives. A group of children utilised their new skills to create a small business at their local market in order to raise money to donate to their chosen charity. We will certainly be using MiniBOSS again and can’t thank them enough for their professional and enthusiastic approach.",

    program: "VCAL Programs",
    title: "Maria - Secondary School Teacher",
    testimonial: `On behalf of the VCAL students and the staff, I would like to thank you for a memorable two days. The Smoothie Bar Enterprise Program was the perfect way for our VCAL students to start the year. It was an opportunity to see these students develop their confidence, self esteem as well as meet many VCAL outcomes and competencies. 
The program went beyond my expectations. It was so lovely to witness so many students flourish in a hands-on practical program, where normally they would be just a wall flower. This program also added value to our VCAL pathway and hopefully we have now changed the mindset of so many students who devalued the VCAL program. What a wonderful way for our Year 12s to be introduced to the Year 7 students. They were ideal role models and made all the Year 7 students feel welcome during the Smoothie Tasting Market. 
The lead up activities and tasks were engaging, inclusive of everyone and pitched at the right level. The transformation of attitude and effort from Day 1 Period 1, to Day 2 Period 6 was extraordinary. Students came out of their shell, took chances and worked in a proud group environment. 
Thank you for this wonderful opportunity.`,

    testimonial: `The Smoothie Bar program immersed students into the world of enterprise in a fun and engaging way.
